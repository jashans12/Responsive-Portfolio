      <p>I am currently attending a web development boot camp, which will prepare me to be certified for full-stack 
          web development. Through the program, I have worked on multiple projects, which are displayed in the Portfolio 
          tab (listed above). I currently have experience with HTML and with CSS. I am also currently working on JavaScript, 
          which will be implemented into my assets. I have the ability to research and learn when I am faced with a problem 
          that is difficult to solve. This has been the focus of my learning as a whole.</p>

      <p>When I'm not working with web development, I enjoy playing and composing music with multiple instruments. My main 
          instrument is piano, however I have been learning the guitar, ukulele, mandolin, and tin whistle as well. I also 
          enjoy playing basketball, and have become a big Jazz fan. I like hiking, walking, and running outside. All of these 
          activities help to refresh my brain when I am working on projects in web development.</p>
